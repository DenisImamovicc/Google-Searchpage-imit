"Creating a imitation of a standard google searchpage using html and css.

25 march 2020-Project completion

Project has been completed with style,positioning and responsiveness of a google searchpage.Some things that did not come with the project was the floating header input bar when the page was scrolled past its original position.

Reasoning was that it would have a high probability of using javascript for proper implementation of the function,which language is not supposed to be used and known in this project.In the programmers case,something similar can be implemented in great sacrifice of the page responsiveness,by manipulating z-axis priority.
